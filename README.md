# FM Simultaneous Competitions

The source code for my website which has proper support for FM simultaneous competitions. 
The website allows for Delegates to independently create and manage their own venues.
Competitors will have to select their venue from a dropdown menu, as opposed to the normal WCA website where they simply write a comment which needs manual processing.
